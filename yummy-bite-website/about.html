                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Yummy Bite was born from a simple dream: to share the joy of food with everyone. Founded in 2018 by food enthusiasts Maria and Luca, our journey began in a small kitchen where fresh, local ingredients turned into unforgettable meals. Today, Yummy Bite is a beloved gathering place, where every dish tells a story of passion, creativity, and community.</p>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>At Yummy Bite, we’re committed to crafting dishes that delight the senses and bring people together. We source farm-fresh ingredients, prioritize sustainable practices, and infuse every plate with love. Our goal is to create not just meals, but memories that linger long after the last bite.</p>
                <h3>Meet Our Chef</h3>
                <p>Chef Elena Rossi, our culinary visionary, brings years of expertise and a flair for bold flavors. Trained in Italy and inspired by global cuisines, Elena crafts each menu item to surprise and delight. Her signature dishes, like our Truffle Mushroom Risotto, are a testament to her dedication to quality.</p>
